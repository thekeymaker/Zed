### Testing Help:

In virtualbox, startup a virtual machine with a Ubuntu type Linux live ISO.  Cancel the default installer and use firefox to download and extract the zip of this project.  Run the script in installer/base_installer/base_installer.sh.  A welcome screen should pop up.  From the next menu select the virtual harddrive. Once installer finishes reboot.

You can get the ISO image form the following link:

Also you can view a video of me installing the base installer at this link:

After the base system is installed and the system has booted successfully, the desktop installer scrip could be used to setup the system with some of my preferred software and settings. 

To do this, run the following script as your normal user.  Not as root.

zed/installer/desktop_installer/setup.sh
