### Testing Help:

In virtualbox, startup a virtual machine with a ubuntu type linux live iso.  Cancel the default installer and use firefox to download and extract the zip of this project.  Run the script in installer/base_installer/base_installer.sh.  A welcome screen should pop up.  From the next menu select the virtual harddrive. Once installer finishes reboot.

You can get the iso image form the following link:

Also you can view a video of me installing the base installer at this link:
